System Structure Overview:

1. KrakenAPIWrapper Class: Handles interactions with the Kraken exchange, such as fetching historical data. This class will utilize krakenex and pykrakenapi for API interactions.

2. StrategyBase Class: An abstract base class defining the interface for trading strategies. Each strategy will derive from this class, implementing its logic for generating trade signals.

3. Concrete Strategy Classes: Implementations of specific trading strategies (e.g., Moving Average Crossover, RSI-based strategy, etc.), each inheriting from StrategyBase.


Strategies:
1. Strategy 1: Momentum-Based Trading
Indicators: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover, Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Logic: Buy when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA and RSI is above a certain threshold (e.g., 50), indicating positive momentum. Sell when the opposite crossover occurs or RSI falls below a certain level, indicating loss of momentum or overbought conditions.


2. Strategy 2: Mean Reversion
Indicators: Bollinger Bands, RSI
Logic: Buy when the price hits the lower Bollinger Band and RSI is below 30, indicating oversold conditions. Sell when the price reaches the upper Bollinger Band or RSI is above 70, suggesting overbought conditions


3. Strategy 3: Volatility Breakout
Indicators: Average True Range (ATR), Moving Average
Logic: Establish a position (buy/sell) when the price moves more than a predefined ATR multiple above/below a moving average, indicating a volatility breakout. Close the position when volatility decreases, or a counter signal is observed.


4. Strategy 4: Trend Following with MACD and ADX
Indicators: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Average Directional Index (ADX)
Logic: Buy when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, and the ADX is above a certain level (e.g., 20), indicating a strong trend. Sell when the MACD line crosses below the signal line or the ADX trend weakens.
